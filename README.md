# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
As a first-time crowdfunder, it is important to be prepared and understand what is needed to run a successful campaign. By analyzing crowdfungind data, it is excepted to provide understanding and assess data of best practices and outcomes for campaigns. Additionally,  personally, this may also provide clarity and confidence in her first crowdfunding campaign as a upcoming playright. 

This dataset was explored on various levels to give insight to Louise in planning a successful campaign. The following, but not limited to, were explored to understand and present what makes a project's campaign successful.
* Types of crowdfunding campaigns (ie. parent categories and subcategories)
* Goal versus Pledged 
* Outcomes of Events (ie. successful, failed, canceled)
* Average donations and number of backers


Louise will be able to use this analysis to not only make decisions for how to categorize and  create appropriate financial goals,but also, when in the calendar year to plan her campaign, how long the campaign should run, and what countries are most responsive to certain campaigns. All and more, will be the foundation for the most successful outcome for Louise's first crowdfunding campaign. 

 
## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Here, goals were analyzed in relation to when campaigns were launched throughout the year by month. A pivot table was created to show, in each month, from January to Dccember, how many successful, failed, and canceled theater events occured.
  
  This analysis can provide clarity on the which months have the most success for hosting crowdfunding campaigns throughout the year.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Here, goals were broken up into  monetary ranges to assess how each financial goal range faired during campaigning, resulting in one of the following outcomes (successful, failed or canceled). The percentage of successful, failed and canceled were calculated to compare each goal range. 

This analysis can provide clarity on the appropriate goal range to set a realistic pledge amount from backers to result in the most successful campaign.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Although no challenges occured, transferring formulas could present some difficulty in the future with larger datasets. 

## Results

What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
1. May and June are the best performing months for crowdfunding campaigns.
2. After May/June, success of campaigns drops significantly, peaking in the month of October, before descending again.

What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
* Goals that are $14999 and less (661/692) are the most successful campaigns and goals above $15,000 have the least success ( and tend not to meet their pledge goals (31/692).

What are some limitations of this dataset?
Some limitations to this dataset are as follows: 
* The 'live' events included have not yet been completed, therefore, it would be beneficial to do another analysis when those events have been completed 
* It would be helpful to know why certain campaigns were canceled and what can be done to prevent canceling, which is assumed to result in some financial loss 


What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
Addiitonal tables and graphs that can be included are the 
* Geographical information for the respective targeted country to give insight on the best location to market and/or host events for crowdfunding during specific times of the year
* The number of donations and percentage funded in relation to the open and close date of the campaign
